## Coffee Roasting

For a long time I have enjoyed espresso. Since mid 2009, I have been roasting
my own coffee from green coffee beans. I started out using the oven, but now I
use two different coffee roasting machines. I mostly use a Behmor 1600, which
has a large batch size and is very consistent. I occasionally use a FreshRoast
Plus 8, for more experimental roasting. I used to like very dark espresso
roasts, but since I started roasting coffee myself I have transitioned to
liking lighter full city or vienna roasts. These lighter roasts allow the
flavors of the different types of coffee beans to stand out more.

## Cooking

I love spicy food. I have been teaching myself how to cook. I started by trying
to reproduce spicy dishes I like. Recently I have been baking breads and making
my own pasta from scratch. I want to learn to cook some Thai dishes next.

## Powerlifting

In my free time I do powerlifting. My current powerlifting total is 1100 lbs.

## Others

I previously enjoyed skiing, sailing, horseback riding, climbing, and
developing/playing computer games. However, I have not had time to do any
of these things recently.
