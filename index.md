# About Me

<img src="/images/image2.jpg" class="floatpic" width=400  height=300 >

I'm Linfeng Zhang from Tsinghua University, Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS). 
I get my Bachelor degree in Northeastern University, School of Computer Science in 2019. 
Currently Iâ€™m a Phd candidate supervised by Kaisheng Ma.
My major research interest is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of deep neural networks via knowledge distillation.
In 2019, I firstly propose the idea of self-distillation. So far, I have also successfully applied knowledge distillation to all kinds of tasks, such as 2D classification detection, segmentation, image-to-image translation, video recognition, point cloud-based detection, BEV based multi-view detection, representation and so on. Please refer to my CV for more information. 

I plan to get my Phd degree in 06/2024 and I'm looking forward to opportunities of internship and jobs now.
