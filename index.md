# About Me

<img src="/images/image2.jpg" class="floatpic" >

My name is Linfeng Zhang. 
I'm currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of [Prof. Kaisheng Ma] at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences], Tsinghua University.
Before this, I received my B.S. degree in computer science from Northeastern University (Shenyang, China) in 2019.
My research interest includes the compression and acceleration of deep learning models such as knowledge distillation and dynamic neural networks. I'm also interested in the design of high-robustness neural networks and computer vision.
