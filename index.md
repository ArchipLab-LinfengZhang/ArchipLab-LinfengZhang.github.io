title: About Me
---

My name is Jason Ansel and I am a 6th year PhD student in [CSAIL] at [MIT]. I
do research with [Saman Amarasinghe] in the [Commit] Group.  I plan to
graduate this year.  After graduation, I will be the Director of Machine
Learning at GoDaddy.

My current primary project is [OpenTuner], an extensible framework for
program autotuning.  We are currently looking for users, if interested the
source code is available on the [OpenTuner] site and you can reach me at
`jasonansel@jasonansel.com` with questions.

Earlier at MIT I started the [PetaBricks] language and compiler project.
PetaBricks is a language that incorporates algorithmic choices to allow an
integrated autotuner to explore search spaces of program implementations.
As an undergraduate I did research with [Gene Cooperman] and helped create
[DMTCP], a user-level distributed checkpoint/restart system.

Since 2011, I have also been working for the startup [Locu] on the side.
I was the first non-founder employee of Locu and my work focused on created
machine learning algorithms for extracting semantic information from
unstructured web content.  In Augst 2013 Locu was [acquired by GoDaddy].
