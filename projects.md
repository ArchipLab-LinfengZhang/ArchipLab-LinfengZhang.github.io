## [OpenTuner]
[OpenTuner] is an extensible framework for building domain-specific
multi-objective program autotuners. OpenTuner supports fully customizable
configuration representations, an extensible technique representation to
allow for domain-specific techniques, and an easy to use interface for
communicating with the tuned program.

## [PetaBricks]
[PetaBricks] is a language and compiler where algorithmic choices are
exposed explicitly to create programs that define a search space of possible
algorithms.  The PetaBricks compiler then uses empirical autotuning to search
over these algorithms for an optimal version.

## [Kendo]
[Kendo] is a library that allows multithreaded programs, that would
normally produce nondeterministic output, to execute deterministically by
enforcing a dynamically computed and efficient ordering of lock acquisitions.

## [DMTCP]

[DMTCP] (Distributed MultiThreaded Checkpointing) is a tool to transparently
checkpoint and restart the state of a distributed cluster computation that
communicates through MPI or sockets.  It works on unmodified binaries at
the user level.

\item {\bf Native Client} is a sandbox for running untrusted machine code in
the web browser.  It is based on ahead of time validation of local constraints
that imply global safety.
